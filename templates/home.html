    Hey there! I'm Utku â€” a self-taught developer on a wild coding journey. I
    write about what Iâ€™ve learned (and what I think Iâ€™m learning) over in the
    Writings section. Feel free to send your thoughts, praise, or bug reports
    through the links below. I tried to keep this site as simple as possibleâ€¦
    and well, this is as simple as I could get. I mean, Iâ€™m no Richard Stallman
    or Kyle Simpson. If youâ€™re into shiny stuff, check out the Projects section
    â€” yes, you, dear recruiter, I see you snooping ðŸ‘€
